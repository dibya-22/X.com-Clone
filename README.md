## X.com Clone

This project is a clone of **X.com** built using **Tailwind CSS**. The goal of this project is to explore and utilize various Tailwind classes while creating a fully responsive design optimized for both **desktop** and **mobile** devices.


### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

### Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dibya-22/X.com-Clone
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a local server and watch for any file changes.

### Tailwind Configuration

The Tailwind CSS configuration is located in the tailwind.config.js file. You can customize the default theme, add plugins, and tweak other options as per your requirements.

### NPM Scripts

Here are the available npm scripts defined in the package.json:

- npm run dev: Starts the local development server and watches for changes in the source files.
- npm run build: Builds a production-ready version of the CSS with optimized styles.

### Notes

- The node_modules folder is not included in the repository. It will be generated automatically when you run npm install.
- Ensure your index.html file is correctly linked to the generated CSS files from Tailwind.
- You may adjust Tailwind's settings, such as colors, spacing, and typography, directly in the tailwind.config.js file.
